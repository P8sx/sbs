# Smart board system 
is modular system of 64mm x 48mm boards that are conected using 6 PIN connector, each SBS module are/will be equip with ESP8285/ESP32 module with 3.3V regulator. 

Goal of a project was to create affordable, small and modular system for home automation. By having WIFI chip on each module you can use it separatly as standalone module, or connect multiple boards with one supervisor to create bigger system.

## WARNING 
Project is in very **EARLY STAGE** (so no file are actually present in repository)

## Standalone mode
Board can be flashed with custom firmware to be used as simple standalone home automation module.

## Supervisor mode
Each board connect using 6 PIN JST SH connector with main supervisor (ESP32/RaspberryPI/PC?) using PJON/OneWire communication interface. Supervisor will be responsible for system working logic ex. (if (input from board x == high) turn relay x on board y)

## Modules

| State | Name | Description | Estimate BOM per board (excl. shipping) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [ ] | Pi zero | Supervisor based on raspberry pi zero w | 15$ |
| [ ] | ESP32 | Supervisor based on ESP32 module | 8$ |

When alarm pin is raised/lowered supervisor/power module will shutdown power for all SBS modules, only way to restore SBS connected modules is to manually reset power
