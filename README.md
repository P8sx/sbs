# Smart board system 
is modular system of 48mm x 48/64/80mm boards that are conected using 4 PIN connector, each SBS module are/will be equip with own low power MCU to manage periphials and communicate with other devices.

Goal of a project was to create affordable, small and modular system for home automation. By connecting multiple boards with one supervisor you can create flexible and expandable system using single bus connector, avoiding the clutter of cables

## Updates
05.05.2022 - Changed connector type to 4 pin JST SH and communication medium to RS485

07.10.2021 - Project suspended

29.08.2021 - Replaced ESP8285 with ATtiny 3227/1627/827

14.09.2021 - Development of project slowed down due to shipping time of equipment, components for testings and personal projects. All files including pcb schematics will be published as soon as i get modules ordered and tested, after that i will start software development part.

## WARNING 
Project is in very **EARLY STAGE** (so no file are actually present in repository)


## SBS Bus
Curently SBS bus uses JST SH 4 pin connector, and RS485 transceiver
